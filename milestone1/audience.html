        <h2>Who is this site for?:</h2>
        <p>This website is mainly for potential/current employers; however, anyone can view as they wish! They should be able to navigate this site and gain an understanding of the work I have done and the knowledge I have gained during my time in University. These projects will then carry me out into the corporate world, where I hope to show case my abilities with pride and become a part of the amazing tech world we live in today. I am interested in potential employers from all across the nation, and am excited to prove my worth to notable companies!</p>
