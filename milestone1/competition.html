        <h2>What about competition?</h2>
        <p>My goal of this site is to display my knowledge and work to potential employers or coworkers, and to show my
            work. In the process of creating this website, I came across many other portfolios and used them as stepping
            stones to create mine. I saw many amazing sites, but I found a common theme. Some were too difficult to
            navigate for me specifially, which caused frustration. However, their target audience might be future
            employers, in which case, they would be able to navigate more efficiently. I want my personal site to be
            easy to use for both newcomers and experienced alike, and want to find fun but simple ways to showcase the
            journey that I have been on. </p>
